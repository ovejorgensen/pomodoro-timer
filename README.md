# pomodoro-timer

Collaborative web app for the Pomodoro time management technique.\
Created using WebSockets and a Node.js backend, you can use this app to efficiently spend your time and keep your mind fresh!\
By creating a session, your friends can join your timer and you can optimize time spent during project work.

How does it work:
- Pick a task
- Start a 25 minute work-timer
- Work until the time is up
- Take a 5 minute break
- Repeat until you have done 4 _pomodoros_
- Take a longer 25 minute break
